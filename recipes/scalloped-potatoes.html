    <h3>The perfect side dish to a main course or a welcome addition to any potluck supper, Scalloped Potatoes is one of those dishes that seems complicated but is deceptively simple. You’ll need to put in a bit of “peeler time” to get the spuds ready for the oven, but after that, it’s just a long bake and a short standing period to let the sauce thicken. Then, voilà! Your baked Scalloped Potatoes dish is ready to serve. Set it out for an elegant or celebratory dinner, or bring it along to a get-together, and you'll be fielding requests for easy Scalloped Potatoes all year long.</h3>
